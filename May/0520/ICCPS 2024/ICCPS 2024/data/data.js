							"abstract": "Learning-enabled controllers have been adopted in various cyber-physical systems (CPS). When a learning-enabled controller fails to accomplish its task from a set of initial states, researchers leverage repair algorithms to fine-tune the controller's parameters. However, existing repair techniques do not preserve previously correct behaviors. Specifically, when modifying the parameters to repair trajectories from a subset of initial states, another subset may be compromised. Therefore, the repair may break previously correct scenarios, introducing new risks that may not be accounted for. Due to this issue, repairing the entire initial state space may be hard or even infeasible. As a response, we formulate the Repair with Preservation (RwP) problem, which calls for preserving the already-correct scenarios during repair. To tackle this problem, we design the Incremental Simulated Annealing Repair (ISAR) algorithm, which leverages simulated annealing on a barriered energy function to safeguard the already-correct initial states while repairing as many additional ones as possible. Moreover, formal verification is utilized to guarantee the repair results. Case studies on an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) and OpenAI Gym Mountain Car (MC) show that ISAR not only preserves correct behaviors from previously verified initial state regions, but also repairs 81.4% and 23.5% of broken state spaces in the two benchmarks. Moreover, the average signal temporal logic (STL) robustnesses of the ISAR repaired controllers are larger than those of the controllers repaired using baseline methods.",

							"abstract": "Autonomous cyber-physical systems with deep-learning components have shown great promise but have so far enjoyed limited adoption. Part of the problem is that, beyond average-case analysis, guaranteeing robustness and reasoning about worst-case behaviors in these systems is difficult. Previous research has developed attacks that can degrade a system's performance using small perturbations on observed states, as well as ways to retrain the networks that appear to make them robust to such attacks. In this work, we advance the state of the art by developing a new method called the Zero-One Attack, which is able to bypass the current strongest defense. The Zero-One Attack minimizes reward by combining an outer loop zeroth-order gradient-free optimization with an inner loop, first-order gradient-based method. This setup both reduces the dimensionality of the zeroth-order optimization problem and leverages efficient gradient-based search methods for neural networks, such as projected gradient descent. In addition to state observation noise, we consider a new attack model with bounded perturbations to the execution time instant of the control policy, as real-time schedulers usually guarantee execution once per period, which may not be strictly periodic. On the Mujoco Half Cheetah system with the best current defense, the Zero-One Attack degrades the performance 195% beyond the state-of-the-art, which increases to 522% more degradation when also attacking timing jitter.",

							"abstract": "Controller Area Network (CAN) is considered to be the de facto standard for intra-vehicular communication of modern automobiles. Due to the lack of strong authentication and confidentiality schemes, CAN has been the popular target of a multitude of attacks in the last two decades. Among such attacks, the Bus-off attack (BoA) is considered an important attack vector since it helps the attacker impersonate a trusted safety-critical controller while actually sending false messages. In this paper, we uncover the limitations of classical BoA along with the recent variants in the context of targeting specific automotive safety-critical control loops. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art system-agnostic BoAs are actually futile in the presence of rudimentary range and gradient-based signal monitors that filter out signals exhibiting drastic changes. Instead, we propose a new attack model FalCAN that maximally impacts a given automotive closed-loop while maintaining stealth against monitors. Given the control and bus network specifications, the attack first figures out maximal delays that can be introduced for targeted control loops while attempting BoA. The attack then identifies suitable false data sequences for such delayed actuations that maximize the state error while staying undetected. We implement this attack model on automotive-grade ECUs with benchmark CAN traffic and visualize the impact by real-time emulation of the plant using Hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulation.",

							"abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) play a pivotal role in modern critical infrastructure, spanning sectors such as energy, transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing. These systems combine digital and physical elements, making them susceptible to a new class of threats known as cyber kinetic vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities can exploit weaknesses in the cyber world to force physical consequences and pose significant risks to both human safety and infrastructure integrity. This paper presents a novel tool, named Rampo, that can perform binary code analysis to identify cyber kinetic vulnerabilities in CPS. The proposed tool takes as input a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formula that describes the kinetic effect\u2014i.e., the behavior of the \u201Cphysical\u201D system\u2014that one wants to avoid. The tool then searches the possible \u201Ccyber\u201D trajectories in the binary code that may lead to such \u201Cphysical\u201D behavior. This search integrates binary code analysis tools and hybrid systems falsification tools using a Counter-Example Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR) approach. In particular, Rampo starts by analyzing the binary code to extract symbolic constraints that represent the different paths in the code. These symbolic constraints are then passed to a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to extract the range of control signals that can be produced by each of the paths in the code. The next step is to search over possible \u201Cphysical\u201D trajectories using a hybrid systems falsification tool that adheres to the behavior of the \u201Ccyber\u201D paths and yet leads to violations of the STL formula. Since the number of \u201Ccyber\u201D paths that need to be explored increases exponentially with the length of \u201Cphysical\u201D trajectories, we iteratively perform refinement of the \u201Ccyber\u201D path constraints based on the previous falsification result and traverse the abstract path tree obtained from the control program to explore the search space of the system. To illustrate the practical utility of binary code analysis in identifying cyber kinetic vulnerabilities, we present case studies from diverse CPS domains, showcasing how they can be discovered in their control programs. In particular, compared to off-the-shelf tools, our tool could compute the same number of vulnerabilities while leading to a speedup that ranges from 3\u00D7 to 98\u00D7.",

							"abstract": "Achieving fairness in sequential decision making systems within Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) environments is a critical concern, especially when multiple humans with different behavior and expectations are affected by the same adaptation decisions in the system. This human variability factor adds more complexity since policies deemed fair at one point in time may become discriminatory over time due to variations in human preferences resulting from inter- and intra-human variability. This paper addresses the fairness problem from an equity lens, considering human behavior variability, and the changes in human preferences over time. We propose FAIRO, a novel algorithm for fairness-aware sequential decision making in HITL adaptation, which incorporates these notions into the decision-making process. In particular, FAIRO decomposes this complex fairness task into adaptive sub-tasks based on individual human preferences through leveraging the Options reinforcement learning framework. We design FAIRO to generalize to three types of HITL application setups that have the shared adaptation decision problem. Furthermore, we recognize that fairness-aware policies can sometimes conflict with the application's utility. To address this challenge, we provide a fairness-utility tradeoff in FAIRO, allowing system designers to balance the objectives of fairness and utility based on specific application requirements. Extensive evaluations of FAIRO on the three HITL applications demonstrate its generalizability and effectiveness in promoting fairness while accounting for human variability. On average, FAIRO can improve fairness compared with other methods across all three applications by 35.36%.",

While recent works have studied real-time communication over LoRa, they have not considered optimizing control performance. To optimize control performance, industrial automation needs a co-design of real-time scheduling and control. Such a co-design, in general, is highly challenging due to complex dependencies between control performance, plant dynamics, and real-time communication.

In this paper, we propose a highly energy-efficient and scalable framework for real-time scheduling and control co-design for a LoRa network. By taking into account LoRa characteristics, the co-design approach entails state-aware communication and control to dynamically update the sampling rates while meeting real-time constraints.

							"abstract": "Residential smart water meters (SWMs) collect real-time water consumption data, enabling automated billing and peak period forecasting. The presence of unsafe events is typically detected via deviations from the benign profile of water usage. However, profiling the benign behavior is non-trivial for large-scale SWM networks, because once deployed, the collected data already contain those events, biasing the benign profile. To address this challenge, we propose a real-time data-driven unsafe event detection framework for city-scale SWM networks that automatically learns the profile of benign behavior of water usage. Specifically, we first propose an optimal clustering of SWMs based on the recognition of residential similarity water usage to divide the SWM network infrastructure into clusters.

Das Missouri University of Science and Technology, USA sdas@mst.edu Resilient Machine Learning Anomaly Detection Smart Water Distribution Smart Living CPS Residential smart water meters (SWMs) collect real-time water consumption data, enabling automated billing and peak period forecasting. The presence of unsafe events is typically detected via deviations from the benign profile of water usage. However, profiling the benign behavior is non-trivial for large-scale SWM networks, because once deployed, the collected data already contain those events, biasing the benign profile. To address this challenge, we propose a real-time data-driven unsafe event detection framework for city-scale SWM networks that automatically learns the profile of benign behavior of water usage. Specifically, we first propose an optimal clustering of SWMs based on the recognition of residential similarity water usage to divide the SWM network infrastructure into clusters. Then we propose a mathematical invariant based on the absolute difference between two generalized means \u2013 one with positive and the other with negative order. Next, we propose a robust threshold learning approach utilizing a modified Hampel loss function that learns the robust detection thresholds even in the presence of unsafe events.

Building operating systems (BOS), similar to classical OS, provide essential services to applications running on commercial buildings. The current state-of-the-art requires applications to be trusted and carefully monitored due to a lack of authorization, access control, and execution isolation mechanisms that could handle the complexity and scale of modern buildings in a usable manner. This impedes the adoption of \"smart\" applications that can enhance energy efficiency, occupant health, comfort, and productivity. To fill this gap, we develop an operating system abstraction for smart buildings, PlayGround, that incorporates a structured semantic representation of the building to inform the safe, multi-tenant execution of untrusted applications. We use the semantic representation to implement (a) a novel graph-based capability mechanism for fine-grained and expressive access control management, and (b) a resource isolation mechanism with preemptive interventions and passive telemetry-based live resource monitoring. Our proposed solution ensures the practicality and long-term sustainability of adopting untrusted user-facing building applications with a focus on maintenance and management labor costs. In this demo, we demonstrate the user interaction with PlayGround with several real applications in a real building.",

When responders arrive at the scene of an MCI, one of their first tasks is to locate individuals and assess their injuries promptly, known as triage. After triaging victims, responders physically tag them with a color-coded label indicating their injury severity before identifying other victims. Fast and efficient victim tagging serves as a critical initial step in the MCI process, providing vital information that guides subsequent decisions.

Data from sensors like cameras and lidars, after being processed by NNs, feed control algorithms that form the core of autonomy-related functions. Such NNs are implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs) and modern GPUs can be partitioned into multiple virtual machines, each implementing a separate NN. Given an autonomous system with multiple NNs, how should each NN be sized and the GPU implementing them be optimally partitioned? In this work, we study multiple GPU partitioning techniques with the goal of optimal system-level control performance.",

At present, automation in vehicles is limited to advanced driver-assistance systems such as adaptive cruise control, which require constant human supervision. A key step toward full automation is realizing communication between vehicles and road infrastructure (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure, V2I) and communication between different vehicles (Vehicle-to-Vehicle, V2V). Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) that leverage V2V and V2I technologies (together called Vehicle-to-Everything, V2X) have information beyond the capabilities of their local sensors which can lead to better informed, and therefore safer, decisions. However, CAVs are not yet available to the general public and additional research is required to understand how these vehicles could perform during the various stages of their potential deployment. One approach to study the performance of CAVs at scale is co-simulation, where a road network could be modeled together with a V2X communications network to evaluate the impact of CAV deployments on the transportation system. The IEEE High-Level Architecture (HLA) is a co-simulation standard that is well-suited for evaluating such complex scenarios but has scalability issues with respect to the number of processes required to run a co-simulation and the amount of data those processes may need to exchange at runtime. This paper presents a novel approach to create scalable co-simulations of road transportation networks containing CAVs and vehicle communication networks. The CAVs are aggregated into a single process while retaining distinct virtual identities in the HLA co-simulation, reducing the number of processes required to control the vehicles and the number of messages required to communicate between simulations.

One notable drawback is the insufficient provision for disadvantaged individuals who may require additional time to evacuate due to their slower running speed. Moreover, the existing escape strategies may fall short of ensuring the safety of all individuals during a crowd surge. To address these pressing concerns, this paper proposes two crowd management methodologies. Firstly, we advocate for implementing a fair evacuation strategy following a surge event, which considers the diverse needs of all individuals, ensuring inclusivity and mitigating potential risks. Secondly, we propose a preventative approach involving the adjustment of attraction locations and switching between stage performances in large-crowded events to minimize the occurrence of surges and enhance crowd dispersion. We used high-fidelity crowd management simulators to assess the effectiveness of our proposals. Our findings demonstrate the positive impact of the fair evacuation strategy on safety measures and inclusivity, which increases fairness by 41.8% on average. Furthermore, adjusting attraction locations and stage performances has shown a significant reduction in surges by 34% on average, enhancing overall crowd safety.",

These systems employ computational components and real-time controllers to meet power demands. Microgrids, comprising interconnected components, energy resources within defined electrical boundaries, computational elements, and controllers, offer a solution for integrating renewable energy sources and ensuring resilience in electricity demand. Simulating these cyber-physical systems (CPS) is vital for grid design, as it facilitates the modeling and control of both continuous physical processes and discrete-time power converters and controllers. This paper presents a model-based design tool for simulating cyber-physical power systems, including microgrids, using SystemC-AMS. The adoption of SystemC-AMS enables physical modeling with both native components from the SystemC-AMS library and user-defined computational elements. We observe that SystemC-AMS can accurately produce the electromagnetic transient responses essential for analyzing grid stability. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SystemC-AMS through use cases that simulate grid-following inverters.

							"abstract": "Most studies on machine learning in sensing systems focus on low-level perception tasks that process raw sensory data within a short time window. However, many practical applications, such as human routine modeling and occupancy tracking, require high-level reasoning abilities to comprehend concepts and make inferences based on long-term sensor traces. Existing machine learning-based approaches for handling such complex tasks struggle to generalize due to the limited training samples and the high dimensionality of sensor traces, necessitating the integration of human knowledge for designing first-principle models or logic reasoning methods. We pose a fundamental question: Can we harness the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to recognize complex events from long-term spatiotemporal sensor traces? To answer this question, we design an effective prompting framework for LLMs on high-level reasoning tasks, which can handle traces from the raw sensor data as well as the low-level perception results. We also design two strategies to enhance performance with long sensor traces, including summarization before reasoning and selective inclusion of historical traces. Our framework can be implemented in an edge-cloud setup, running small LLMs on the edge for data summarization and performing high-level reasoning on the cloud for privacy preservation. The results show that LLMSense can achieve over 80% accuracy on two high-level reasoning tasks such as dementia diagnosis with behavior traces and occupancy tracking with environmental sensor traces.

							"abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) is acclaimed for its potential to bridge the physical and virtual worlds. Yet, current integration between these realms often lacks a deep understanding of the physical environment and the subsequent scene generation that reflects this understanding. This research introduces Sensor2Scene, a novel system framework designed to enhance user interactions with sensor data through AR. At its core, an AI agent leverages large language models (LLMs) to decode subtle information from sensor data, constructing detailed scene descriptions for visualization. To enable these scenes to be rendered in AR, we decompose the scene creation process into tasks of text-to-3D model generation and spatial composition, allowing new AR scenes to be sketched from the descriptions. We evaluated our framework using an LLM evaluator based on five metrics on various datasets to examine the correlation between sensor readings and corresponding visualizations, and demonstrated the system's effectiveness with scenes generated from end-to-end. The results highlight the potential of LLMs to understand IoT sensor data.

Yet, current integration between these realms often lacks a deep understanding of the physical environment and the subsequent scene generation that reflects this understanding. This research introduces Sensor2Scene, a novel system framework designed to enhance user interactions with sensor data through AR. At its core, an AI agent leverages large language models (LLMs) to decode subtle information from sensor data, constructing detailed scene descriptions for visualization. To enable these scenes to be rendered in AR, we decompose the scene creation process into tasks of text-to-3D model generation and spatial composition, allowing new AR scenes to be sketched from the descriptions. We evaluated our framework using an LLM evaluator based on five metrics on various datasets to examine the correlation between sensor readings and corresponding visualizations, and demonstrated the system's effectiveness with scenes generated from end-to-end. The results highlight the potential of LLMs to understand IoT sensor data. Furthermore, generative models can aid in transforming these interpretations into visual formats, thereby enhancing user interaction. This work not only displays the capabilities of Sensor2Scene but also lays a foundation for advancing AR with the goal of creating more immersive and contextually rich experiences.",

NetBench is built upon seven publicly available datasets and encompasses a broad spectrum of 20 tasks, including 15 classification tasks and 5 generation tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate eight State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) classification models (including two foundation models) and two generative models using our benchmark.

In this paper, we propose ArtFL, a novel federated learning system designed to support dynamic runtime inference through multi-scale training. The key idea of ArtFL is to utilize the data resolution, i.e., frame resolution of videos, as a knob to accommodate dynamic inference latency requirements. Specifically, we initially propose data-utility-based multi-scale training, allowing the trained model to process data of varying resolutions during inference. Subsequently, we introduce an innovative strategy for frame resolution selection in inference, based on the similarity of adjacent frames. Finally, leveraging latency-based dynamic data dropping, we propose a systematic scheme to reduce the overall training time by shortening the waiting time in FL. For evaluation, we build two real-world FL testbeds for smart vehicles and healthcare applications, utilizing a heterogeneous edge platform.

In this paper, we present WiCloak, the first system that protects WiFi device location privacy while supporting normal WiFi communication simultaneously.

We evaluate the communication performance of WiCloak on commercial WiFi receivers (e.g., MacBook and Mac Studio) and demonstrate that it achieves the same packet reception rate as normal WiFi.

							"abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction holds paramount importance across numerous applications, profoundly impacting user experience and business profitability. The freshness of a CTR prediction model significantly influences its performance, since users' needs and interests may be changing over time, thereby requiring the model to be updated frequently. However, stringent data protection regulations have constrained the collection of users' personal data, posing challenges to traditional model refreshing strategies that rely on centralized data collection. On-device learning techniques, such as federated learning (FL), offer a viable solution by enabling model training on devices without compromising user privacy. Nevertheless, the scarcity of training data with diverse distributions among devices presents considerable obstacles to on-device learning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce RelayRec, a cloud-device relay learning framework designed for privacy-preserving CTR prediction. To establish competent initial models for devices, RelayRec categorizes pre-regulation cloud data into user preference groups, training preference-specific models for devices. Furthermore, a cloud-based automated model selector is developed to identify suitable initial models for devices.

The freshness of a CTR prediction model significantly influences its performance, since users' needs and interests may be changing over time, thereby requiring the model to be updated frequently. However, stringent data protection regulations have constrained the collection of users' personal data, posing challenges to traditional model refreshing strategies that rely on centralized data collection. On-device learning techniques, such as federated learning (FL), offer a viable solution by enabling model training on devices without compromising user privacy. Nevertheless, the scarcity of training data with diverse distributions among devices presents considerable obstacles to on-device learning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce RelayRec, a cloud-device relay learning framework designed for privacy-preserving CTR prediction. To establish competent initial models for devices, RelayRec categorizes pre-regulation cloud data into user preference groups, training preference-specific models for devices. Furthermore, a cloud-based automated model selector is developed to identify suitable initial models for devices. To elevate the relay learning performance of these initial models, we incorporate a personalized collaborative learning mechanism that aggregates device models based on user preferences. Extensive experimental evaluations underscore RelayRec's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, affirming its efficacy in privacy- preserving CTR prediction.",

							"abstract": "Today's wireless sensor networks focus on achieving reliable data transfer over a lossy medium at the expense of latency. However, sensor data are often noisy and thus only lossily characterise real-world phenomena, rendering their exact transfer wasteful. Furthermore, many next-generation privacy-sensitive applications, such as smart grid control, real-time distributed object tracking, and inter-vehicle federated learning face latency and traffic bottlenecks due to the sheer amount of data collection required to overcome noise. We tackle this problem by introducing Twofer, a communication approach which reduces latency and traffic in high-noise or high-privacy settings by abandoning the focus on reliable networking. Twofer empowers developers to tune networks for latency-bound rather than reliability-bound performance; the system coordinates ambiguous transmissions, which are used to estimate the network-wide distribution of data, rather than to reliably communicate exact data from individual nodes. Twofer's full-stack design maintains black-box compatibility with existing application code, but advocates for, and shows the value of, uncommon physical-layer features such as symbol-synchronous communication. The system is therefore implemented and evaluated on a prototype low-latency wireless mesh network called Zero-Wire.

LoRa encodes data across multiple samples to enable long-range communication, with the level of redundancy controlled by the Spreading Factor (SF).

SF-any encodes a quasi-SF (k+m) symbol with 2^m SF k symbols. Hardware imperfections introduce time-varying frequency drifts and phase offsets, resulting in frequency leakage during quasi-SF (k+m) packet decoding. To mitigate this, we strategically insert pilots into the packet for imperfection estimation and compensation. Additionally, to maintain and exploit the coding structure in LoRa PHY, we employ a grouped repetition code at the transmitter and a joint demodulation and decoding scheme at the receiver. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SF-any's performance seamlessly scales with increasing SF, achieving up to a 14dB improvement over SF12 packets (the highest SF in LoRa PHY), and up to a 12dB improvement compared with state-of-the-art approaches.",

Therefore, we first study the three sensors' strengths and weaknesses carefully, then compare several different fusion strategies to maximize their utility. Finally, based on the lessons learnt, we propose a simple yet effective multi-modal 3D object detection and tracking framework (namely EZFusion). Without fancy network modules, our proposed EZFusion makes remarkable improvements over the LiDAR-only baseline, and achieves comparable performance. For intelligent transportation, far-range perception with roadside sensors is vital. The main challenge of far-range perception is performing accurate object detection and tracking under far distances (e.g., > 150m) at a low cost. To cope with such challenges, deploying both millimeter wave Radars and high-definition cameras, and fusing their data has become a common practice. Towards this goal, the first question is to conduct the association on the 2D image plane or the BEV plane. We argue that the former is more suitable because the magnitude of location errors in the perspective projection points is smaller at far distances on the 2D plane, leading to more accurate association. Thus, we first project the Radar points to the 2D plane and then associate them with the camera-based 2D object locations. Subsequently, we map the camera-based object locations to the BEV plane through inverse projection mapping (IPM) with the corresponding depth information from the Radar data. Finally, we engage a BEV tracking module to generate target trajectories. Our system is capable of achieving an average location accuracy of 1.3m when we extend the detection range up to 500m.",

							"abstract": "Device interrupts have long been a problem in real-time systems. Handling an interrupt in the context of a critical task potentially leads to a missed deadline. While modern systems have proposed techniques to schedule interrupts, the challenge is to determine the correct priority based on the task that triggers their occurrence. One approach is to assign an interrupt with the highest priority among all tasks waiting on a corresponding device. However, this does not fully eliminate priority inversion, as the interrupt may be handled at a much higher priority than the task with which it is associated. To solve this problem, we present a solution for devices connected to a Universal Serial Bus (USB). USB has properties that make it potentially suitable for tackling high bandwidth sensor data processing and low-latency input/output (I/O) control. We describe the implementation of an xHCI (USB 3.x) driver in the Quest RTOS, which guarantees throughput and delay requirements for USB devices and their I/O requests using time-budgeted interrupt handling servers. Our paper is the first to introduce differentiated USB interrupt servicing.

Handling an interrupt in the context of a critical task potentially leads to a missed deadline. While modern systems have proposed techniques to schedule interrupts, the challenge is to determine the correct priority based on the task that triggers their occurrence. One approach is to assign an interrupt with the highest priority among all tasks waiting on a corresponding device. However, this does not fully eliminate priority inversion, as the interrupt may be handled at a much higher priority than the task with which it is associated. To solve this problem, we present a solution for devices connected to a Universal Serial Bus (USB). USB has properties that make it potentially suitable for tackling high bandwidth sensor data processing and low-latency input/output (I/O) control. We describe the implementation of an xHCI (USB 3.x) driver in the Quest RTOS, which guarantees throughput and delay requirements for USB devices and their I/O requests using time-budgeted interrupt handling servers. Our paper is the first to introduce differentiated USB interrupt servicing. Experiments show how our approach outperforms a Linux xHCI driver running on a PREEMPT_RT-patched system with SCHED_DEADLINE tasks. Differentiated USB interrupt handling is shown to improve the performance of Quest's default xHCI driver, which is purposely designed to provide real-time I/O guarantees.",

The sporadic DAG task model is a parallel task model adept at representing tasks comprised of subtasks, which possess internal data flow and precedence constraints induced by synchronization. A significant challenge to the system's performance and its real-time verification stems from the communication-centric nature of applications in these domains. Inter-core communication, required for data sharing among subtasks across different cores, depends on either a shared bus or a network-on-chip, culminating in significant overhead due to latency, congestion, and synchronization. To improve performance and reduce these overheads, it is advantageous to execute subtasks, those that either exchange large volumes of data or access the same data, on a singular physical processor, thereby utilizing more efficient intra-core communication. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing the DAG task model with execution groups, incorporating a constraint that mandates the execution of grouped subtasks on the same processor. We provide an analysis of worst-case response times and propose optimizations for our DAG task model with execution groups, subsequently evaluating our approach against existing solutions. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach, even with the imposition of group execution constraints, remains competitive in comparison to existing approaches that do not take group execution constraints into account. Additionally, we explore implementation strategies and potential extensions for multi-task systems.",

To improve performance and reduce these overheads, it is advantageous to execute subtasks, those that either exchange large volumes of data or access the same data, on a singular physical processor, thereby utilizing more efficient intra-core communication. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing the DAG task model with execution groups, incorporating a constraint that mandates the execution of grouped subtasks on the same processor. We provide an analysis of worst-case response times and propose optimizations for our DAG task model with execution groups, subsequently evaluating our approach against existing solutions. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach, even with the imposition of group execution constraints, remains competitive in comparison to existing approaches that do not take group execution constraints into account. Additionally, we explore implementation strategies and potential extensions for multi-task systems.",

							"abstract": "Synchronizing clocks is a resource-intensive and a resource-rigid task; this makes it challenging to align time across resource-constrained and heterogeneous IoT devices. Just as low-power IoT devices harvest energy from the environment, we propose to scavenge timing information from environmental events to conserve device power and bandwidth. We convert ambient events in an environment \u2013 sensed by various sensing modalities \u2013 into synchronization signals. Our approach, HAEST, leverages prevalent sensors on commodity platforms such as accelerometer, microphone, and optical sensors to timestamp commonly observed events. We present a light-weight and robust approach to detect events across different types of sensors and devices. This creates ample opportunities to align time and simultaneously avoid the clocks to drift apart.

Anwar University of Massachusetts Amherst fanwar@umass.edu Time Synchronization Sensing Modalities Ambient Events Synchronizing clocks is a resource-intensive and a resource-rigid task; this makes it challenging to align time across resource-constrained and heterogeneous IoT devices. Just as low-power IoT devices harvest energy from the environment, we propose to scavenge timing information from environmental events to conserve device power and bandwidth. We convert ambient events in an environment \u2013 sensed by various sensing modalities \u2013 into synchronization signals. Our approach, HAEST, leverages prevalent sensors on commodity platforms such as accelerometer, microphone, and optical sensors to timestamp commonly observed events. We present a light-weight and robust approach to detect events across different types of sensors and devices. This creates ample opportunities to align time and simultaneously avoid the clocks to drift apart. Through evaluation on a hardware testbed in a smart home and a wireless body area network, we show that HAEST achieves clock accuracy as low as sub-milliseconds with no cost for IoT devices. Importantly, our use of off-the-shelf IoT platforms in our evaluations, establishes the universality and applicability of our approach to a variety of smart spaces with heterogeneous devices.",

							"abstract": "Multi-core platforms are becoming increasingly prevalent in cyber-physical systems such as automobiles and robots. However, contention for shared resources makes it challenging to guarantee timing predictability. Existing studies have primarily focused on characterizing the extent to which such interference can induce delays (usually from an adversarial perspective). Unfortunately, less is understood on the physical impacts of these timing delays in different cyber-physical platforms. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing an empirical examination of the end-to-end effects of performance interference on real-world applications. We analyze the root causes of harmful interference and summarize potential implementation pitfalls. To automate this process, we introduce TimeTrap, a tool that analyzes performance interference in autonomous systems through the lens of control outcome. To understand the extent to which timing interference may cause control deviations, TimeTrap has to strategically leverage different magnitudes of resource contention to trigger targeted deadline miss patterns. Through this exercise, we found that a naive approach that maximizes task latency via performance interference may fail to trigger worst-case outcomes (i.e. physical damages) due to built-in fail-safe mechanisms. As a result, delays have to be induced in a stealthy manner to avoid triggering fail-safes. To achieve this, TimeTrap first employs a system that actively injects fine-grained delays into the target software, adjusting the duration based on measured feedback. Second, TimeTrap leverages predictability in CPS execution patterns and resource usage to automatically tune its aggressor workloads, matching these patterns to achieve targeted interference and execution delays in a victim. We evaluate TimeTrap on two physical-world platforms and six platforms in a hardware-in-the-loop simulation environment, including robotic arms, UGVs, UAVs, self-driving cars, and humanoid robots.

							"abstract": "Modern IoT/edge applications require one-to-many wireless communication (e.g., multi-drone coordination, data sharing among vehicles, synchronized IoT light shows). Due to the constantly varying wireless medium, thus reception quality, the sender must adjust its transmitting rate on a per-frame basis to meet the goodput and loss requirements of multiple receivers. Deciding an optimal rate within tens of milliseconds from nearly a hundred or more choices and continuing to chase that moving target is extremely challenging. Existing wireless technologies have little support for multicast rate control: most works are designed for unicast, where one receiver sends explicit per frame feedback, which is infeasible to scale to multiple receivers; a few works for multicast have rigid structures and high overhead unsuitable for IoT/edge; and most designs are based on a common implicit assumption: higher rates incur more losses. In this paper, we conduct systematic experiments and find that only a small fraction of data rates are practically useful, and higher rates can incur similar or even lower losses, thus cutting the data rate table size by 3.8X, making it manageable to select the optimal rate within a short duration.

Due to the constantly varying wireless medium, thus reception quality, the sender must adjust its transmitting rate on a per-frame basis to meet the goodput and loss requirements of multiple receivers. Deciding an optimal rate within tens of milliseconds from nearly a hundred or more choices and continuing to chase that moving target is extremely challenging. Existing wireless technologies have little support for multicast rate control: most works are designed for unicast, where one receiver sends explicit per frame feedback, which is infeasible to scale to multiple receivers; a few works for multicast have rigid structures and high overhead unsuitable for IoT/edge; and most designs are based on a common implicit assumption: higher rates incur more losses. In this paper, we conduct systematic experiments and find that only a small fraction of data rates are practically useful, and higher rates can incur similar or even lower losses, thus cutting the data rate table size by 3.8X, making it manageable to select the optimal rate within a short duration. We further design an application-adaptive multicast rate control feedback protocol (r-DACK) with two policies enabling receivers to specify their desired loss rate, or loss rate and goodput requirements. r-DACK enables most receivers to meet their goodput/loss requirements while not being \"bogged down\" by some stragglers with bad reception quality.

Working with the municipality of Amsterdam, we propose a method for counting people with mmWave in a real outdoor scenario. These realistic scenarios pose two significant difficulties. First, it is hard to estimate the number of people when they walk together because the radar captures the group as a single-point cloud.

Digital interventions such as continuous cardiac monitoring solutions can help to monitor the patient's status and provide valuable feedback to clinicians to detect early warning signs and provide effective interventions. This paper presents iCardiAx, a wearable sensor based on low power high sensitivity accelerometers that measures vital signs essential for cardiovascular health monitoring, namely, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and respiratory rate (RR). A dataset has been collected from 10 healthy subjects with the iCardiAx wearable chest patch to develop low-complexity, lightweight vital sign measurement algorithms and evaluate their performance. The experimental evaluation demonstrates high performance vital sign measurement for RR (0.11 (0.77) breaths per minute), HR ( 0.82 (2.85) beats per minute), and systolic BP (0.08 (6.245) mm of Hg). The proposed algorithms are embedded on the ARM Cortex M33 processor supporting Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Estimation of HR and RR achieved an inference time of only 4.2 ms and 8.5 ms for BP. Moreover, a multi channel quantized Temporal Convolutional Neural (TCN) Network has been proposed and trained on the open source HiRID dataset to have a large number of patients with data for sepsis ground truth. The model has been trained and evaluated using only digitally acquired vital signs as input data that could be collected by iCardiAx to detect the onset of Sepsis in a real-time scenario. The TCN has been fully quantized to 8-bit integers and deployed on iCardiAx. The network showed a median predicted time to sepsis of 8.2 hours with an energy per inference of 1.29mJ. iCardiAx has a sleep power of 0.152 mW and an averages a power of 0.77 mW for always-on sensing and periodic on-board processing and BLE transmission. With a small 100 mAh battery, the operational longevity of the wearable has been estimated at two weeks (432 hours) for measuring the three cardiovascular parameters (HR, BP and RR) at a granularity of 30 measurements per hour per vital sign, running inference every 30 minutes.

							"abstract": "Small-scale autonomous airborne vehicles, such as micro-drones, are expected to be a central component of a broad spectrum of applications ranging from exploration to surveillance and delivery. This class of vehicles is characterized by severe constraints in computing power and energy reservoir, which impairs their ability to support the complex state-of-the-art neural models needed for autonomous operations. The main contribution of this paper is a new class of neural navigation models \u2013 NaviSlim \u2013 capable of adapting the amount of resources spent on computing and sensing in response to the current context (i.e., difficulty of the environment, current trajectory, and navigation goals).

To validate ASLRing, instead of recruiting learners, we conducted a comprehensive user study with a database with 1080 sentences generated by a vocabulary size of 1057 from 14 native sign language users and achieved a 26.9% word error rate, and we also validated ASLRing in diverse settings.",
